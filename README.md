# Mollyfish chat Web

This is a Web part for my pet project "Mollyfish chat" chatting application meant to be secure, encrypted and easy to use

## Before you go any further

🚧 Work in porgress here 🚧

Note that this project is not ready yet. Although I am currently working on it, and hopefully you will see progress in the future

Also, I am just learning the backend and NestJS framework in general. This is not meant to be ideal. In fact nothing is ideal in this world 🤷

The mantra:
    - Perfectionism is obsolete. It makes things more complicated than needed 🙅
    - To be productive one should be disciplined and dedicated 💁
    - There is no need to force one to do anything. Otherwise nothing will be done right 🤦
    - Explicit is better than emplicit 💁
    - Well organised and intuitive is better than spontaneous and random 💁
    - Any science at some point may seem magic 🔮 
    - Magic reevaluetes to sciene once studied enough 👨🏻‍🔬
    - Quantity of content is significant, but the quality is more important

### Introduction

The app purpose, generaly is to create a chatting application on my own, and provice it with functionality I want
This pet project was inspred by one of my (once) colleague's one. This version is another attempt in creating such an app
Another source of inspiration is the fact that Telegram is build by not trustworthy individual, while Whatsapp being a kid of evil corporation, viber being old and Discord being not really reliable in my eyes

## "What's on the menu?" or The What

Fish!

 1. Having fun
 2. [ ] Basic comunications such as:
    - write messages ✍
    - forward them 📨
    - answer ✒
    - delete messages 🗑
    - distinct DMs, public Chatrooms, private Chatrooms and, maybe, channels
 3. [ ] End-to-End encryption of messages. Perhaps with some fancy lgorithm 🛡
 4. [ ] Reactions on messages with emojis  🤙
 5. [ ] File sending 📂

The application in my eyes is sort of Hybrid between Slack and Telegram if talking about the frontend

## The How

 1. [ ] For sending and receiving messages there should be WebSockets
 2. [ ] Well-tested algorythms to flawlessly execute any operation with no real bugs
 3. - Quality over quantity

Personaly, I'd want to use RxJS and Angular Signals API a lot, since both are powerfull tools. The second one could also increase performance of the app

## The WHen

As soon as possible, idealy

### What does this mean to me

For me this project is a challenge. I want to create something on my own. I want to make something good. To be able to show it and have no hesitation. I want to build something I would **want to use myself**
Since it is a pet project meant to create a solid portfolio in the first place — it is also a playground to learn
